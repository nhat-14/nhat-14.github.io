## Navigation of Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGV) using multiple vision-based algorithms

<div style="text-align: justify">During my internship at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST) in March - May 2019, I was part of the team responsible for designing an analog control system for an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) that could operate efficiently in industrial environments. Using CAN-bus technology, we were able to create a system that allowed for seamless communication between the AGV and its surrounding environment. This project was completed in collaboration with UBIQELIFE Technology Corporation. </div>

**Problem statements**:
* Testing and intergrating vision-based sensor for AGV.
* Setup CAN-bus for the AGV.
