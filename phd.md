## Surpassing Natural Experts in Odor Source Localization Through Inverse Reinforcement Learning

<div style="text-align: justify">I am using deep inverse reinforcement learning to learn the odor search strategy of the silkworm moth in nature and export a reward function from it to apply to the autonomous mobile robot for safety and rescue tasks. </div>

**Problem statements**:
* Finding gas source in obstacle region.
* Learning from natural expert which is silkworm moth.
