## Probabilistic mapping of gas distribution in a cluttered indoors environment.

During my summer exchange at Tokyo Institute of Technology, I conducted research on the Chemical Plume Tracing robot, integrating SLAM with chemical sensing to enhance gas tracking in complex indoor spaces. This aimed to enable real-time navigation and mapping of gas distribution.

I built a bio-inspired chemical tracing robot and used it to obtain the gas distribution map by offline-processing data from chemical sensing using the Kernel DM + V method.
