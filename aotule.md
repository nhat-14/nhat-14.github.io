## Probabilistic mapping of gas distribution in a cluttered indoors environment

I conducted research on the Chemical Plume Tracing (CPT) robot, integrating SLAM with chemical sensing to enhance gas tracking indoor. This aimed to enable mapping of gas distribution. An Omnidirectional robot and used it to obtain the gas distribution map by offline-processing data from chemical sensing using the Kernel DM + V method.

**Problem statements**:
* Distribution of gas is dominated by turbulence.
* Long response time and long recovery time of gas sensors.
* Gas source is not always in an area with the highest gas concentration.
* A single measurement from sensor provides information about a very small area.
* Robot collects measurements from diï¬€erent areas but still able to infer the position of the source.
