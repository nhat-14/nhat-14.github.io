## Designing intelligent autonomous robot using the SLAM algorithm, RRT* algorithm, and Fuzzy-PID techniques

During my last years at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, I researched motion planning for autonomous mobile robots integrated with SLAM, RRT* algorithm, and Fuzzy-PID control techniques, aiming to create a robust and intelligent robot capable of autonomous navigation in an environment with obstacles.

**Problem statements**:
* Making path planner for RRT* algorithm.
* Bulding a mobile robot prototype which can navigate in obstacle region.
